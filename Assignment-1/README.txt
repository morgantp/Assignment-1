For this piece a very basic piece and then changing elements of the code and
adding pieces to make it look more interesting and complex. For example I
changed the colour values to so the colours of the shapes are different shades
of the same colour and movement of the mouse changes the colour of the shapes
all together. My piece putting it very basically spawns several shapes of varying
size and colour from a corner each shape has a line attached to it similar to a
yo-yo all the shapes leave a trail and this trail and the user interaction is
what ensures the piece looks different every time you load it.
